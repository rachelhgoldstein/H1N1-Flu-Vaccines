## Overview:
There have been several deadly pandemics throughout history, the topic of this project being the flu. According to the CDC, the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. The H1N1 strain (also known as swine flu) was the cause of the 2009 pandemic, affecting millions worldwide. Significant efforts have since been made to develop and distribute vaccines to protect against this strain.

## Business Problem
My target audience is a public health official, such as the leadership team of the CDC. I was tasked with predicting whether someone has received their H1N1 vaccination. The results will be used to help provide guidance for future health concerns. 

Making sure youâ€™re vaccinated and protected against contagious diseases such as the flu is important not just for your own health and safety, but for those around you. The goal with any contagious disease, such as the H1N1 flu, is to reach herd immunity status, which is when a large enough percent of the population has developed antibodies to protect against future infections. This will ultimately help limit the spread of the disease.

## Data
The data used in my analysis comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. Some key points:
- There were nearly 27,000 participants.
- Data was collected randomly through phone surveys.
- Participants were asked a range of questions, including if they were vaccinated, their age, gender, employment status, and other key questions.
